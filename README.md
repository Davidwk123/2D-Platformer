A mini platformer game using SFML libraries

Press "Space" to jump and use arrow keys to move left and right. Goal is to get to the red mark at the top right of the screen.

I have included the wall.cpp which allows me to create multiple platforms with different sizes. The game.h and game.cpp which includes everything else. The font file which is needed to show the text in the program and the driver. 

I included the folder "myGame" that has the .exe to run the game
